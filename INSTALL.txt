Installation:

1. Install and enable the module as usual. Prerequisites include
   the Amazon module (http://drupal.org/project/amazon) and optionally
   the panels module (http://drupal.org/project/panels)
2. Configure the various items in admin->settings->amazon. NOTE THAT ONLY THE US LOCALE 
   IS CURRENTLY SUPPORTED BY amazon_store.
3. Make sure you're running cron, or the store's inventory will get hopelessly out of
   date with the actual Amazon inventory.
4. Configure the various items in admin->settings->amazon store. 
5. Optionally enable and configure the Item Page panel. A default panel is provided.
