amazon_store 1.0beta2 2009-04-05
----------------------
- Added ability to configure default items in amazon_store by SearchIndex,
  BrowseNode, or by an ItemId list of ASINs
- Added admin capability to turn on or off the Search at the top of the amazon_store page,
  and also turn on or off the "Narrow By" and "Sort By" forms
- Added ItemId type as part of URL
- Added CHANGELOG.txt
- Added javascript behavior to show/hide full project description on the
  search results page
- Removed ugly extra entries under the amazon_store menu item
- Moved the search form into themable territory. You can theme the entire
  search results page (/amazon_store) by putting amazon_store_search_results.tpl.php
  into your theme's directory and then changing it. So you can change everything
  about that page.  Patches for improved display are welcome, as is CSS that you like.
