amazon_store 1.0beta4 2009-July
--------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
#492460: Shopping cart image did not display in many situations.
#494304: Add to cart on Ubercart causes Amazon Store error messages.


amazon_store 1.0beta3 2009-05-29
--------------------------------

Bug fixes:

#474610: "Add to cart" should increment count if the cart already has item in it
#466616: Button images don't show if clean urls turned off
#461598: When SearchIndex equals All, BrowseNode cannot be present.

I also turned off the drupal_set_message() that by default was shown any time 
the Amazon API returned an error, regardless of whether it was significant to 
the user or not. These things still go into watchdog.

amazon_store 1.0beta2 2009-04-05
----------------------
- Added ability to configure default items in amazon_store by SearchIndex,
  BrowseNode, or by an ItemId list of ASINs
- Added admin capability to turn on or off the Search at the top of the amazon_store page,
  and also turn on or off the "Narrow By" and "Sort By" forms
- Added ItemId type as part of URL
- Added CHANGELOG.txt
- Added javascript behavior to show/hide full project description on the
  search results page
- Removed ugly extra entries under the amazon_store menu item
- Moved the search form into themable territory. You can theme the entire
  search results page (/amazon_store) by putting amazon_store_search_results.tpl.php
  into your theme's directory and then changing it. So you can change everything
  about that page.  Patches for improved display are welcome, as is CSS that you like.
